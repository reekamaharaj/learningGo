different solutions or help others solve their difficulties

- [Golang Redit](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang)
- [Go Forum](https://forum.golangbridge.org/)

## Twitter influencers

Having mentors is insanely important and can drive the wheel so much
faster in software engineering. Make sure to follow the best of the
best in the community and keep up with the latest news

## Books

These are books which I've read, reading at the moment or books which
are the best known in the community. There's no better explanation than
one in a book. Grab some coffee and read some cool Go books â˜•â˜•â˜•

- [The Go Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440)
- [The way to Go](https://archive.org/details/TheWayToGo)

## YouTube channels

For people who like learning visually and preferably free good video
tutorials seems like an impossible task to accomplish. YouTube is
so full of videos and until you find something good, it takes time
or you simply don't find. 

Here are a list of channels I consider are the best for learning Go
and I myself have subscribed to:

- [JustForFunc](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_BzFbxG2za3bp5NRRRXJSw)
- [Gopher Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx9QVEApa5BKLw9r8cnOFEA/feed)
- [GopherCon UK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9ZNrGdT2aAdrNbX78lbNlQ)
- [Coding Tech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtxCXg-UvSnTKPOzLH4wJaQ)
- [The Go Programming language](https://www.youtube.com/user/gocoding)
- [GOTO Conferences](https://www.youtube.com/user/GotoConferences)
- [Russ Cox](https://www.youtube.com/user/rscgolang)
- [Learn to Code - Todd McCleod](https://www.youtube.com/user/toddmcleod)

## Udemy courses

YouTube or other similar free video services can be overwhelming
and cluttered many times. You don't just find good free videos, that's
why the best videos are those organized inside courses

Of course paid courses, but let's be serious this is like the cheapest
platform where you get lifetime access to courses and updates

These are the courses I've finished when I first started to learn Go
and recommend doing if you're like me and like learning from
videos

- [Learn How To Code: Google's Go (golang) Programming Language - T. McCleod](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/)
- [Web Development w/ Googleâ€™s Go (golang) Programming Language - T. McCleod](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-programming-language/)
- [Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang) - Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/)

## GitHub

GitHub is the place where Open Source is. It's also the place where
are the latest changes, nothing is more actual the master branch

Wanna be in touch with what's happening in the Go world, have a
look at these repositories full of examples and best practices on
writing idiomatic Go code

## Mail subscriptions

The best way to be up to date is by letting someone notify you
We all use mail boxes, so that the best way to stay tuned and keep in
touch with the latest trends in Go

Be careful and stay away from spamming your Inbox
